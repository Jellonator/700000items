List of callbacks:
evaluate_cache: Called when cache is refreshed (stat upgrades)
room_change: Called when room is changed
player_take_damage: Player takes damage
enemy_take_damage: Enemy takes damage
on_add: Called when item is added to a player
on_pickup: Called when item is picked up by player
on_remove: Called when player removes an item (D100/D4/etc.)

on_pickup differs from on_add because on_pickup only activates when picking up
an item from an item pedestal. on_add activates with the giveitem command, the
D4, and the D100. on_pickup is used to drop items on pickup, while on_add is
used in conjunction with on_remove to make sure that the player has the right
stuff

MC_USE_PILL and MC_USE_CARD only work for custom pills and cards
The following would be cool but don't work because no callbacks:
on_usage
take_pill
use_card
