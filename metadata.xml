    <description>Do you like The Binding of Isaac? Are you bored of the currently existing items
and wish there were more of them? Like, a lot more? Maybe even 700,000 more?

Well, then this mod is for you!

Featuring at least 1000 randomly generated bootleg items with random stats,
effects, names, and sprites!

*there is not actually 700,000 items. Not that it would be impossible, but it makes the game horribly slow to start and would take a lot of time to actually generate this many items.
